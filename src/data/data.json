In a large bowl, combine pudding mix, water, and sweetened condensed milk.  Fold in half of the whipped cream.  In a trifle bowl, make a layer of brownies.  Spread 1/3 of the chocolate mixture on top of the brownies, and then 1/3 of the whipped cream on top of that.  Repeat the layers until you fill the bowl.  Top with the shaved chocolate.  Chill overnight."
